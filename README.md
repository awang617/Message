## Inspiration
My inspiration from this project sprung from a book I read once called The Language of Flowers (Vanessa Diffenbaugh). The main character of the book started a florist business called Message, and she used the language of flowers to arrange her bouquets. The idea of using the language of flowers for a floral arrangement business was very intriguing to me and something I wish actually existing. My app, Message, was built as a mockup for how this character might make an online presence for her business.

The database for this project utilize six different tables. A user has an order, which has order details that I also used to store information for the shopping cart.
